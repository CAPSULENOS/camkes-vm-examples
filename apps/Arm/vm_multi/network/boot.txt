- Boot process:
    - Read the config file
        - Pop an error if it isn't there
    - Read how many nodes are requested
    - See if we can allocate enough nodes
        - Report to logs if not
        - Exit
    - Assign names to each of the nodes
    - Determine the number of links needed to get the network running
        - This is going to determine the number of vlans we need
            - Need routing 
    - Determine where all the links need to pass through to get forwarded to the output
    - Set up the different links:
        1) Go to start of connection and set up vlan link
        2) Go to first item in through and set up vlan link in and out
        3) Repeat step 2 with all the p
    - Set up the forwarding in the control node
        1) Iterate through the links and set a forwarding path for the start and end
            - Possibly bi-directional. Shouldn't have to adjust anything but flags though
    - Determine the "functional nodes"
    - Determine what functionality is executing on what functional node
    - Set up the functionality programs
        NOTE: These should take the vids as arguments to make life easier
        NOTE: These need to be stand alone binaries / scripts for QoL
            Would be nice if the can execute from the openvswitch node, but we'll get there 
            eventually
    - QED




NOTE: Should add a debug and randomization mode for vlan ids so they can just increase 
    monotonically for ease of use

NOTE: Bidirectionality on the links is enforced at the openvswitch level
